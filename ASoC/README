# Original code used to generate ASoC results.

File: prepare_variants.sh
Language: bash
Comments:
  Prepare genetic variants (i.e. SNPs) for the ASoC analysis.


File: split_reads_by_cell_type.py
Language: Python3
Comments:
  A customized script to split reads for BAM files into small ones according to
  the cell barcode (CB) field.

Language: bash
Comments:
  A customized pipeline to count allelic reads per individual.


File: merge_asoc_rc.r
Language: bash
Comments:
  A customized R script to merge allelic read counts across the whole study
  cohort.


File: estimate_asoc.r
Language: R

Language: bash, R
Comments:
  A customized workflow to asign TF motifs to COVID-19 GWAS SNPs.


File: annotate_asoc_snps.r
Language: R
Comments:
  A customized R script to annotate ASoC SNPs that are identified by
  estimate_asoc.r which is mentioned the above.


File: enrich_asoc_snps.r
Language: R
Comments:

  files generated by split_reads_by_cell_type.py which is mentioned the above.


File: plot_qqplot.r
Language: R
Comments:
  A customized R script to draw QQ plot to show COVID-19 GWAS p-values of
  identified ASoC SNPs by estimate_asoc.r which is mentioned the above.


File: plot_resource_track.r
Language: R
Comments:
  A customized R script to draw track plots to show the data integration for
  given ASoC SNPs.


File: target_sceQTL.r
Language: R
Comments:
